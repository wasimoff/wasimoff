# FFmpeg-WASI

This example uses an FFmpeg binary compiled for the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI). It is
standalone and requires no JavaScript glue; only a suitable WebAssembly runtime with WASI support.

    wasmtime ./ffmpeg.wasm -- -version

Sources and build instructions can be found at
[github.com/SebastiaanYN/FFmpeg-WASI](https://github.com/SebastiaanYN/FFmpeg-WASI). It is built in a
Docker container, which unfortunately takes a long time. To avoid licensing issues, the binary is
not committed herein though.
